 <title>Video: Drupal is Stupid (But I Love It Anyway)</title>
 <link>http://drupaldork.com/2012/07/video-drupal-stupid-i-love-it-anyway</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; property=&quot;content:encoded&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;This past weekend was the second CapitalCamp here in DC, and I wound up doing a session on Friday morning. I was one of the organizers of the event, but submitted two sessions early on (mostly to start filling up the Proposed Sessions list). When it became clear that we had a ton of great session proposals (and I was going to have my hands full all weekend), I withdrew my proposals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, a speaker had to cancel his session a few days before the camp, and since I had previously done this talk at the DC PHP user group back in November, I was asked if I could fill the slot by doing it again. I think it worked out well: I&#039;ve been asked by a lot of people who couldn&#039;t make it back in November if there was a video available, but at the time, I didn&#039;t really know how to use Keynote and failed to record it. This open timeslot gave me a chance to record a video, and to update some of the content of the talk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In any case, I think it went pretty well. The audio peters out near the end: the Q&amp;amp;A became more of a discussion, which was great at the time but didn&#039;t get picked up by the mic.&lt;/p&gt;
