 <title>DrupalCon Munich</title>
 <link>http://drupaldork.com/2012/09/drupalcon-munich</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; property=&quot;content:encoded&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;DrupalCon Munich took place last week—well, last-last week, I guess—and it was pretty rad. I just got home a couple days ago, myself. My wife Erin and I figured that as long as I was in Germany already, we may as well make a trip of it, so she flew out on Friday (the sprint day of the con) and we spent the weekend in Munich, then flew up to Berlin for the following week. The whole trip was a blast, but we&#039;re talking about DrupalCon here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I&#039;m being honest, the first couple days of the conference were largely lost on me. I was more jet-lagged than I thought, and I think a little bit culture-shocked by failing to understand just about everything that was being said around me. I took a year of German in college (eight years ago now), but that did remarkably little for my ability to communicate with people there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once my sleep cycle evened out and I got my legs under me, I had a great time. I wound up spending a lot of time talking with the newly-former &lt;a href=&quot;http://drupalladder.org/content/steering-group&quot;&gt;Drupal Ladder Steering Committee&lt;/a&gt; about what we were doing and how, which was exactly the refresher I needed for that project. The Drupal Ladder has been my primary focus in the contrib world for a couple months, but I hadn&#039;t been very enthusiastic about it of late. Doling out responsibilities and making some decisions during DrupalCon made me feel a lot better about where we&#039;re going and how we&#039;re going to get there, so the week was worth it just for that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also really enjoyed the &quot;Get Involved with Core Sprint&quot; on Friday. This was a sprint led primarily by the &lt;a href=&quot;http://drupal.org/core-office-hours&quot;&gt;core mentoring crew&lt;/a&gt; (meaning &lt;a href=&quot;http://drupal.org/user/65776&quot;&gt;xjm&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://drupal.org/user/241634&quot;&gt;tim.plunkett&lt;/a&gt; this time around), and it went swimmingly. &lt;a href=&quot;http://drupal.org/user/258568&quot;&gt;Cathy&lt;/a&gt; and I hosted a BOF on Thursday afternoon to help new sprinters get setup with a local Drupal 8 site, and it wound up being remarkably effective: a bunch of first-time sprinters arrived Friday morning all setup and ready to contribute! Fellow Lullabots &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.lullabot.com/about/team/addison-berry&quot;&gt;Addi&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.lullabot.com/about/team/joe-shindelar&quot;&gt;Joe&lt;/a&gt; led a workshop in the morning to get people more completely setup: local dev site, git, how to use IRC and the issue queue, etc. Between the BOF and the workshop, the entire group was firing on all cylinders by noon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A ton of issues were worked on, and it seemed like everyone knew what they were doing: I kept wandering the room, looking for people that needed help, but no one did! Instead, I spent most of my time looking for more issues that people could work on because the group was chugging through them so quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Talking about the Ladder and helping out at the sprint were definitely the highlights of my DrupalCon. I only attended a few sessions, including the two I spoke at (&lt;a href=&quot;http://munich2012.drupal.org/program/sessions/drupal-ladder-resources-and-activities-meetups-help-members-learn-and-contribute&quot;&gt;Drupal Ladder&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://munich2012.drupal.org/program/sessions/beer-or-not-beer-making-meetups-work&quot;&gt;Making Meetups Work&lt;/a&gt;), and didn&#039;t even make it to any core conversations, but it was a very productive week. Now I need to go back and &lt;a href=&quot;http://blip.tv/drupalcon&quot;&gt;watch the videos&lt;/a&gt; for a bunch of sessions I missed!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

 <title>It&#039;s almost time for Munich!</title>
 <link>http://drupaldork.com/2012/08/its-almost-time-munich</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; property=&quot;content:encoded&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Holy crap, can you believe that DrupalCon Munich is just two weeks away? This summer has been flying by!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I, for one, am equal parts excited and apprehensive. DrupalCons are always exciting: I get to see friends I&#039;ve made over the last couple years, and always meet a ton of new people. But, at the same time, I&#039;m a little bit worried about two things: finding my way around, and being on a panel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I really shouldn&#039;t be nervous about the panel. I&#039;ll be speaking with &lt;a href=&quot;http://drupal.org/user/298852&quot;&gt;Karyn Cassio&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://drupal.org/user/65088&quot;&gt;Addi Berry&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://drupal.org/user/72810&quot;&gt;Paul Johnson&lt;/a&gt; about &lt;a href=&quot;http://munich2012.drupal.org/program/sessions/beer-or-not-beer-making-meetups-work&quot;&gt;making local meetups work&lt;/a&gt;, in the last session slot on Wednesday. All three of them are easy to talk to, and we&#039;ve got a ton of information and ideas to share.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Getting around should be…ok. I did take a year of German in college, so I know some basics, but not enough to understand the answer to any question that I might manage to ask. I know that a lot of people speak English, and I&#039;m banking on that more than anything else. This afternoon, I finally took a close look at the (very intimidating) &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mvv-muenchen.de/fileadmin/media/Dateien/plaene_en/pdf/netz_2012_en.pdf&quot;&gt;map of the train network&lt;/a&gt;, and the part I need to navigate will be pretty straightforward. The map looked way more confusing when I just gave it a once-over before, because the station names are hard to differentiate when you don&#039;t know what most of them mean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Getting from the airport to the Westin Grand will be fine, but at the end of the week, I need to make my way closer to the middle of the city to meet my wife at the hotel whe&#039;re we&#039;ll be spending that weekend—and she needs to find her way there from the airport, without even the cursory understanding of German that I&#039;ve got. Without cell phones, it will be hard to get in touch to coordinate or warn about delays. I&#039;ve been trying to figure out the situation with cell phones in Germany, and I think we might be best served by a couple cheap pre-paid voice-only units, instead of trying to get an actual data plan on our iPhones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So yes: it&#039;s all very exciting and just a little bit terrifying, but I can&#039;t wait to see everyone in Munich!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

 <title>Video: Drupal is Stupid (But I Love It Anyway)</title>
 <link>http://drupaldork.com/2012/07/video-drupal-stupid-i-love-it-anyway</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; property=&quot;content:encoded&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;This past weekend was the second CapitalCamp here in DC, and I wound up doing a session on Friday morning. I was one of the organizers of the event, but submitted two sessions early on (mostly to start filling up the Proposed Sessions list). When it became clear that we had a ton of great session proposals (and I was going to have my hands full all weekend), I withdrew my proposals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, a speaker had to cancel his session a few days before the camp, and since I had previously done this talk at the DC PHP user group back in November, I was asked if I could fill the slot by doing it again. I think it worked out well: I&#039;ve been asked by a lot of people who couldn&#039;t make it back in November if there was a video available, but at the time, I didn&#039;t really know how to use Keynote and failed to record it. This open timeslot gave me a chance to record a video, and to update some of the content of the talk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In any case, I think it went pretty well. The audio peters out near the end: the Q&amp;amp;A became more of a discussion, which was great at the time but didn&#039;t get picked up by the mic.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Follow-up: This Module Doesn&#039;t Work Right (And What You Can Do About It)</title>
 <link>http://drupaldork.com/2012/06/follow-module-doesnt-work-right-and-what-you-can-do-about-it</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; property=&quot;content:encoded&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;I gave this talk at Drupaldelphia this past weekend, and finally got around to pulling together some resources for those interested. The video is below; it was recorded in Keynote, so it&#039;s just the slides and the audio is so-so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How-tos&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://drupalladder.org/lesson/93887717-c398-2434-394c-cf10851b4f1c&quot;&gt;Apply a patch&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://drupal.org/node/1155816&quot;&gt;How to format an issue summary&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To checkout the &lt;code&gt;-dev&lt;/code&gt; branch of a module, follow &lt;a href=&quot;http://f.cl.ly/items/1T1U2X282u3F401r1o3f/Views%20%7C%20drupal.org.png&quot;&gt;the instructions on the &lt;strong&gt;Version control&lt;/strong&gt; tab&lt;/a&gt; on the project page. For example: &lt;a href=&quot;http://drupal.org/project/views/git-instructions&quot;&gt;Views version control info&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Misc&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://drupal.org/core-office-hours&quot;&gt;Core mentoring hours&lt;/a&gt; are a great way to get more involved in Drupal development and get more comfortable working in the issue queues.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don&#039;t forget to check &lt;a href=&quot;http://drupal.org/project/issues/user&quot;&gt;Your Issues&lt;/a&gt; to follow up on issues you&#039;re involved with.&lt;/li&gt;

 <title>Speaking Gigs Coming Up</title>
 <link>http://drupaldork.com/2012/06/speaking-gigs-coming</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; property=&quot;content:encoded&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&#039;ve got an exciting couple of months ahead of me!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next Friday, June 22, I&#039;ll be speaking at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.drupaldelphia.com/&quot;&gt;Drupaldelphia&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.drupaldelphia.com/sessions/module-doesnt-work-right-and-what-you-can-do-about-it&quot;&gt;This Module Doesn&#039;t Work Right (And What You Can Do About It)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last weekend of July will be the second &lt;a href=&quot;http://capitalcamp.org/&quot;&gt;CapitalCamp&lt;/a&gt; here in DC. Session selections are happening this week, so the chosen sessions will be announced soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In August, I&#039;ll be off to Germany for &lt;a href=&quot;http://munich2012.drupal.org/&quot;&gt;DrupalCon Munich&lt;/a&gt;. I&#039;ll be on a panel about organizing local meetups, along with &lt;a href=&quot;http://drupal.org/user/298852&quot;&gt;Karyn Cassio&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://drupal.org/user/65088&quot;&gt;Addison Berry&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://drupal.org/user/72810&quot;&gt;Paul Johnson&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;a href=&quot;http://munich2012.drupal.org/program/sessions/beer-or-not-beer-making-meetups-work&quot;&gt;To Beer Or Not To Beer? Making meetups work.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#039;s going to be a nerdy summer!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

 <title>Let&#039;s Talk About Sex</title>
 <link>http://drupaldork.com/2012/05/lets-talk-about-sex</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; property=&quot;content:encoded&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;As it often is, sexism in the tech industry was the topic of a lot of back-and-forth on Twitter this past week. It started with &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/populist/status/205016245936979968&quot;&gt;the revelation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; that a modeling agency in Denver &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.modelbuzz.tv/2012/03/14/denver-modeling-agency-finds-success-at-drupalcon/&quot;&gt;had been contracted to staff &quot;booth babes&quot;&lt;/a&gt; in the DrupalCon exhibit hall back in March, and continued (as it so often does) with debate over what behavior is appropriate at professional-ish industry events like DrupalCon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The issue of &quot;booth babes&quot;&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:2&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:2&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; is the one that got under my skin the most, so let&#039;s talk about that. First, allow me outline my basic position on the issue:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;I have no problem with sex. Sex can be a natural, zesty enterprise, but that doesn&#039;t mean it has a place at professional events.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I believe that the mere presence of &quot;booth babes&quot; is actively detrimental to the gender equality of any event or the industry in which it takes place.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I do not think a dress code for booth staff or event attendees is appropriate, nor am I convinced (yet) that this is a problem that should be addressed by an official code of conduct or exhibitor agreement or anything like that.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The problem with booth babes is simple: hiring sexy ladies to stand at a booth and attract men to it results in those men assuming that beautiful women in the booths are only there to attract them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&#039;s it. It&#039;s not some puritanical view of sex, as was suggested to me, nor a problem with sexiness, as was suggested to others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&#039;t know why this is so hard to get one&#039;s head around. Booth babes are there only to sexually arouse men&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:3&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:3&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and draw them into the booth. They cannot answer questions about the product or provide deep information about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their knowledge of the company or product is not the problem, though; the problem is that everyone comes to assume that the sexy ladies in the booths are just that: sexy ladies who don&#039;t know anything about the product. Women who are actually active in the community and industry (and who already have a hard enough time being taken seriously in said) are then brushed aside by those who assume that they&#039;re just there as eye candy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This fact was driven home for me when I was talking to a guy at DrupalCamp Maryland a few months ago. The topic came up, and he proudly announced that when he&#039;s interested in a company in an exhibit hall, he&#039;ll walk straight past any women to the nerdy-looking dude at the back of the booth, figuring that he&#039;s the guy who actually knows what he&#039;s talking about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He could not have made my point better for me, but I still had to slowly spell it out for him: this exactly problem. The women you walk past may well be the lead developer(s) on the product, but you assume they&#039;re just there as eye candy because of the fact that booth babes are around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is why some of the conversation on Twitter this week infuriated me so. It&#039;s not about any puritanical view of sex. It&#039;s not about being uncomfortable with sexiness. It&#039;s entirely about further marginalizing women in an industry where gender equality is a long-standing issue that needs to be addressed. There&#039;s no way that this is hard to comprehend, nor did anyone actually answer to this point on Twitter, so I can only assume that they would rather pretend that it&#039;s not a real issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The closest thing I got to a real response on this was the assertion that the person I was talking to had sexy guys at his booth, and I was being sexist for assuming that &quot;booth babes&quot; had to mean women.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seriously, dude?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This point—and the long conversation that followed the next day, about what constitutes appropriate behavior among people who are attracted to others at tech events—points to an incredible blind spot that plagues members of our community who refuse to see this as a problem:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There is not gender equality in our world right now.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can argue that it&#039;s sexist to assume that &quot;booth babes&quot; refers to women. You can argue from the position that men and women should be treated equally, and that women can hit on men just as men can hit on women, and there&#039;s no difference between the two. I can understand why one would take this position, from a logical standpoint, but it simply has no bearing on reality. Behaving as if we have achieved gender equality—and thus, that these issues do not exist—does nothing to rectify those existing inequalities. We can&#039;t just pretend that treating everyone equally will eventually make it so; it&#039;s going to take more than that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;p&gt;As I noted earlier, I don&#039;t believe that an official code of conduct is the best way to address these problems: tech events should have one in place, but it will take more than that to make a real difference, and there are issues that cannot be adequately addressed by rules and regulations. For example, I was also told I was being sexist for proposing that women at these events should be held to a dress code, to prevent the kind of outfits that booth babes might wear. To be clear, I never proposed nor inferred this, but it indicates the problem with addressing this by official means: should there be a dress code in place? Should exhibit hall staff be limited to full-time employees of each company exhibiting? How can you regulate stuff like that?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I maintain that peer pressure is going to be a much more effective solution. We need to make it clear that we will not do business with the kind of company that thinks women are only good for attracting horny geeks to their booth. We need to call out colleagues who behave inappropriately, who make sexist jokes or harass other attendees or staff at these events. We need to explain—again and again and with small words when necessary—why &quot;booth babes&quot; and &quot;booth dudes&quot; are inherently unequal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&#039;d all like to believe that gender inequality is a thing of the past, but people are so willing to demonstrate, time after time, that we aren&#039;t there yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further reading:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&#039;s worth noting that the modeling agency blogged about this months ago, but it only got any attention (as far as I know) when someone discovered the blog post last week. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:1&quot; rev=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&quot;fn:2&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do I need to keep putting &quot;booth babes&quot; in quotes? I feel like I should just because it is such an air-quotey term, but we all know what I&#039;m talking about. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:2&quot; rev=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&quot;fn:3&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, straight men and lesbians, but we know what the target demographic is. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:3&quot; rev=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

 <title>The Boston Initiative in DC</title>
 <link>http://drupaldork.com/2012/04/boston-initiative-dc</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; property=&quot;content:encoded&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last night, a handful of us in DC got together to discuss bringing the Boston Initiative to DC. &lt;a href=&quot;http://groups.drupal.org/node/221964&quot;&gt;My notes are on the DC group&lt;/a&gt;, with links to lots of additional info for those unfamiliar with the project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I expected a pretty quick planning meeting: how often can we do sprints, where can we hold them, who wants to help organize them, etc. Instead, we quickly got off on a tangent about the merits of LearnDrupal.org and concerns about the content, how it&#039;s structured, and whether it&#039;s just duplicating existing training materials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was a bit frustrated by the way it went, but after sleeping on it, I&#039;m really happy it did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See, I went into this with motives of my own. The whole point of the Boston Initiative is to get more developers involved in Drupal core development, but I hoped that holding some training sessions (&quot;learn sprints,&quot; in the parlance of the initiative) would help to attract other, non-Drupal developers into the fold, and maybe even non-developers who are just interested in learning more about Drupal. I figured that even if people only made it up the first few rungs of &lt;a href=&quot;http://learndrupal.org/ladder/ee503327-50be-1904-8d04-9499098cad64&quot;&gt;the Drupal Ladder&lt;/a&gt;, it would at least get them started and involved in the community, and we all know that there is a serious need for more Drupal site builders and developers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the benefit of hindsight, I can admit that this was pretty stupid. I was trying to co-opt the Boston Initiative to make it fit my own goals. I think that my own expectations probably helped to push the conversation in that direction last night, but it was the wrong way to be approaching this project. There are plenty of existing training options out there for Drupal, but this initiative is not about training people to use Drupal: it&#039;s about getting developers involved in the Drupal core, with clear step-by-step instructions and milestones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I&#039;m glad it went that way. I know now that when planning learning and issue sprints, I need to make sure that I&#039;m clear about what kind of learning can be expected—or perhaps more importantly, what should &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; be expected. It would still be great to get more people started with Drupal, but that&#039;s a task for a different initiative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

 <title>DrupalCon Denver Recap</title>
 <link>http://drupaldork.com/2012/03/drupalcon-denver-recap</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; property=&quot;content:encoded&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don&#039;t even know where to begin. This is the best I&#039;ve come up with:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://denver2012.drupal.org/&quot;&gt;DrupalCon Denver&lt;/a&gt; was a roaring success.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was my second DrupalCon, and I had even spent a week in the Colorado  Convention Center a few years ago. I had a pretty good idea what to expect, and it did not disappoint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#039;m still in Denver and still deeply in recovery mode, so I can&#039;t muster much of a recap beyond bullet points, but I think that&#039;ll do. The links to sessions even include videos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Monday&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Arrived, checked in, met up with co-workers, and caught up with some people I met at DrupalCamp MD last month.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Opening Reception in the exhibit hall.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.getcadre.com/&quot;&gt;Cadre&lt;/a&gt;-sponsored party at &lt;a href=&quot;http://wynkoop.com/&quot;&gt;Wynkoop Brewing Company&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Tuesday&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Con actually began, with &lt;a href=&quot;http://denver2012.drupal.org/keynote/dries-buytaert&quot;&gt;opening keynote by Dries&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Attended Eaton&#039;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://denver2012.drupal.org/program/sessions/tame-burrito-understanding-five-layers-drupal&quot;&gt;Tame the Burrito: Understanding the Five Layers of Drupal&lt;/a&gt;: pretty interesting, and entertaining as always.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Attended &lt;a href=&quot;http://denver2012.drupal.org/program/sessions/og7-pride-and-prejudice&quot;&gt;OG7 - Pride and Prejudice&lt;/a&gt;: honestly, I didn&#039;t pay much attention. I don&#039;t use Organic Groups and was just volunteering in that room during that time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;TruffleBOF: got to meet a bunch of people I&#039;ve been talking to in &lt;a href=&quot;irc://irc.freenode.net/drupal-watercooler&quot;&gt;#drupal-watercooler&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Attended &lt;a href=&quot;http://denver2012.drupal.org/program/sessions/changing-tires-60-mph-how-martha-stewart-living-migrated-drupal&quot;&gt;Changing the tires at 60 MPH: How Martha Stewart Living migrated to Drupal&lt;/a&gt;: interesting and well-polished presentation of a whole of new-to-me-info—but was surprised and disappointed that a presentation about a project to re-launch three properties at Martha Stewart included five men involved in planning and managing it, and no women. Perhaps there were just no women involved in the project, but that seems unlikely given the client. The presenter list this year was not as diverse as it should have been, and this seemed to me like an obvious place to get some women on a panel.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Attended Greg Dunlap&#039;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://denver2012.drupal.org/program/sessions/painting-bikeshed-lessons-drupal-8-initiative-owner&quot;&gt;Painting The Bikeshed: Lessons From A Drupal 8 Initiative Owner&lt;/a&gt;: really good talk, but I especially enjoyed his off-the-cuff responses to questions from the audience. He had some really good advice for anyone leading an open-source project.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Official DrupalCon party at City Hall nightclub. At first, I really didn&#039;t like the place: it was packed and way too loud for conversation. A few of us wound up gathering in a quieter area upstairs so we could chat, and it wound up being a lot of fun.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Wednesday&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Attended &lt;a href=&quot;http://denver2012.drupal.org/keynote/mitchell-baker&quot;&gt;Mitchell Baker&#039;s keynote&lt;/a&gt;: interesting to hear what Mozilla has been up to, though I don&#039;t think she adequately addressed the tough questions from the audience regarding video codecs and how Personas is supposed to be better than OpenID.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Attended &lt;a href=&quot;http://denver2012.drupal.org/program/sessions/drupal-contribution-ladder-gift-and-challenge-you-boston&quot;&gt;The Drupal Contribution Ladder: A Gift and a Challenge to You from Boston&lt;/a&gt;: I&#039;m really excited about what the Boston group has been doing over at &lt;a href=&quot;http://learndrupal.org/&quot;&gt;LearnDrupal.org&lt;/a&gt;. They also hosted a BOF in the afternoon to get people to write up some simple lessons for the site, and I intend to continue contributing to that project when I can. There&#039;s a real need for more experienced Drupal site builders and developers, and those people need to start at the beginning; this site will be a great resource for people who want to dip their toe in and get started.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Attended Fabien Potencier&#039;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://denver2012.drupal.org/program/sessions/drupal-8-meets-symfony2&quot;&gt;Drupal 8 Meets Symfony2&lt;/a&gt;: prior to this session, there were a lot of questions floating around about how Symfony2 was going to be integrated in Drupal 8, and this presentation really clarified (for me, anyway) what Symfony2 really is—turns out, not just an MVC framework—and what parts will be used in Drupal.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Attended Randy Fay&#039;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://denver2012.drupal.org/content/future-drupal-governance&quot;&gt;The Future of Drupal Governance&lt;/a&gt;: as Randy&#039;s sessions tend to be, this was a brief presentation followed by a lot of discussion from the group. Randy and others have since moved this discussion to &lt;a href=&quot;http://drupal.org/project/issues/governance&quot;&gt;an issue queue on d.o&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Had dinner with the Jackson River team at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rootdowndenver.com/&quot;&gt;Root Down&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Caught the second half of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.eatoncon.com/&quot;&gt;EatonCon 2012&lt;/a&gt; at Rock Bottom Brewery and met a ton of people. Sometime around midnight, my ability to remember names maxed out, and every new person after that just overflowed the buffer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Thursday&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;After EatonCon, Thursday had no chance of starting on time. I missed &lt;a href=&quot;http://denver2012.drupal.org/keynote/luke-wroblewski&quot;&gt;Luke Wroblewski&#039;s keynote&lt;/a&gt;, then spent some time at the Jackson River booth, and before I knew it, it was lunch time and the con was almost over.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Attended Gábor&#039;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://denver2012.drupal.org/program/sessions/thrown-shark-pond-guide-surviving-core-development-and-even-enjoying-it&quot;&gt;Thrown Into a Shark Pond? A Guide for Surviving Core Development and Even Enjoying It&lt;/a&gt;: this was a good primer for people like me who want to get into core development, and a good prep for Friday&#039;s sprint (more on that below).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Attended webchick&#039;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://denver2012.drupal.org/content/whats-next-drupalorg&quot;&gt;What&#039;s next for Drupal.org?&lt;/a&gt;: it was interesting to consider how much has been done on d.o in the past year, and how much more really needs to be done. There are several projects—most notably, upgrading the site to D7—that &lt;strong&gt;really&lt;/strong&gt; need to get done.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Attended the &lt;a href=&quot;http://denver2012.drupal.org/schedule/closing-plenary&quot;&gt;Closing Plenary&lt;/a&gt;: the most notable part of this (aside from seeing all the volunteers that made DrupalCon happen) was hearing about &lt;a href=&quot;http://saopaulo2012.drupal.org/&quot;&gt;DrupalCon Sao Paulo&lt;/a&gt;. This December will see the first DrupalCon in Latin America, and I think that announcement came completely out of the blue (hah!) for everyone there. They also officially announced &lt;a href=&quot;http://portland2013.drupal.org/&quot;&gt;DrupalCon Portland&lt;/a&gt; for 2013, but the website was up a day earlier so everyone already knew about it; Sao Paulo was the big news of the afternoon.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Attended the Drupal Association Board Meeting: mostly boring business-y discussion, but it was interesting to see how they work.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Most of the Jackson River folks went on a brewery safari, and the Drupal trivia night took place at the convention center, but I was so beat up from the parties the rest of the week that I made it an early evening to rest up for Friday.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Friday&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sprint day! I&#039;ve been meaning to get into core development for months, and the &lt;a href=&quot;http://xjm.drupalgardens.com/blog/friday-march-23-drupal-core-mentoring-day&quot;&gt;core mentoring sprint&lt;/a&gt; was exactly the kick in the pants I needed to get into it. Many thanks to &lt;a href=&quot;http://drupal.org/user/65776&quot;&gt;xjm&lt;/a&gt; for all the instructions and work she&#039;s been doing in this area for months, and to &lt;a href=&quot;http://drupal.org/user/396253&quot;&gt;linkclark&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://drupal.org/user/241634&quot;&gt;tim.plunkett&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://drupal.org/user/226976&quot;&gt;ZenDoodles&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://drupal.org/user/404732&quot;&gt;cweagans&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://drupal.org/user/293443&quot;&gt;kbell&lt;/a&gt; for helping so many of us out with questions throughout the day. &lt;a href=&quot;http://jacksonriver.com/&quot;&gt;Jackson River&lt;/a&gt; has graciously granted a few of us developers some time to take part in &lt;a href=&quot;http://drupal.org/core-office-hours&quot;&gt;core mentoring hours&lt;/a&gt; in IRC, so I&#039;ll be able to continue helping out with core issues every Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that pretty much brings me up to the present. I&#039;ve spent my evening catching up on email and RSS feeds and packing up the suitcase worth of stuff that managed to overtake my hotel room throughout the week. I have to be up early tomorrow to catch my flight home, and I was too wiped to do anything fun tonight anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DrupalCon lived up to the high expectations I had for it: I learned a lot, met so many people that I can&#039;t possibly remember most of their names, and can happily spend my Friday night relaxing in a hotel room, satisfied that I&#039;ve made the most of my week. I&#039;m going to miss everyone, but once I catch up on sleep, I know I&#039;ll be invigorated to get more involved, to write more patches and create more modules and help more people on IRC—and missing everyone just makes this once-a-year event all the better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you, Denver team, for putting on such a great event, and thanks to everyone who attended and breathed life into it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EDIT&lt;/strong&gt;: Almost forgot. At the official party Tuesday night, I fumbled my iPhone and shattered the rear glass panel. But, thanks to a &lt;a href=&quot;http://drupalize.me/&quot;&gt;Drupalize.me&lt;/a&gt; sparkle pony sticker, it&#039;s been patched up nicely!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/brockli/7010201027/&quot; title=&quot;Sparkle Pony iPhone Fix, on Flickr&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7209/7010201027_bedd50d2ca_n.jpg&quot; width=&quot;196&quot; height=&quot;320&quot; alt=&quot;Sparkle Pony iPhone Fix&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

 <title>DrupalCon Chicago</title>
 <link>http://drupaldork.com/2011/03/drupalcon-chicago</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; property=&quot;content:encoded&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;
    I know it&#039;s been over a week, but I&#039;m &lt;strong&gt;finally&lt;/strong&gt; getting caught up on sleep and email after Drupalcon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    This was my first DrupalCon - well, my first anything-con, really - and it wasn&#039;t quite what I was expecting. I don&#039;t mean that in a bad way: I just didn&#039;t really know what to expect, I guess, so reality wasn&#039;t quite what I was imagining. I had a lot of fun and learned all sorts of things, but I definitely learned some important lessons for next year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;Sleep more the week before the con.&lt;/strong&gt; This one is obvious, and I even had fair warning that it would be a sleep-deprived week, but because of other projects I didn&#039;t get to stock up as much as I should have. Frankly, I got a solid 6 or 7 hours every night I was there, but there was so much going on all week that it was far more exhausting than a regular week at home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;Meet more people.&lt;/strong&gt; My one disappointment is that I didn&#039;t get to meet more people. I did meet some new folks and spend more time with people I had met briefly at the DC Drupal meetup, but I was expecting to get to know a lot more people. When I arrived at the Sheraton on Monday, I wandered around the hotel a bit to see what was where, and found tons of people working on their latops. I thought that on that first day, everyone would be catching up with old friends and hanging out, not elbow-deep in code. I&#039;m not sure how that observation really applies to my &quot;meet more people&quot; plan, but I&#039;ll have to keep it in mind next year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;Find more time for community.&lt;/strong&gt; This one is less about DrupalCon specifically, and something that I need to focus on year-round. For DrupalCon specifically, I&#039;d like to take part in more BoF&#039;s and get involved in more projects next time around. On the morning of the second day, Ben and I were talking about deciding between sessions that were in the same time slot, and he pointed out that we could attend one and watch the video from the other one after the con. That&#039;s when I realized, we could watch &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; of the videos later on, and spend the rest of the day in BoF&#039;s, since those wouldn&#039;t be taped and it was the only chance to experience them. I only wound up attending a few BoF&#039;s, but it was enough to show me that the sessions are for people that want to learn someting, while the BoF&#039;s are for people that want to contribute and get some work done. I definitely want to attend plenty of these next year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    Similarly, I want to make more time for the community in the time between cons, too. There is so much happening on &lt;a href=&quot;http://groups.drupal.org&quot;&gt;groups.drupal.org&lt;/a&gt; and in the project issue queues, and I&#039;ve barely scratched the surface in terms of involvement. I honestly don&#039;t know how anyone can keep up on groups, maintain a couple projects, and still follow conversations on IRC, but I would like to start including them at least a little bit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;Find more time to contribute code.&lt;/strong&gt; I now have &lt;a href=&quot;http://drupal.org/project/multi_smtp&quot;&gt;two contrib&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://drupal.org/project/webform_ab&quot;&gt;modules available&lt;/a&gt; on drupal.org, and would like to add more. There are a few other modules that I need to clean up and document before releasing them, and a couple more ideas that I haven&#039;t started yet. Furthermore, I know that I should be submitting and reviewing patches a lot more than I have been again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    For both code and community, I need to make more time: not &lt;em&gt;find&lt;/em&gt; time, but &lt;em&gt;make&lt;/em&gt; time. Something else is going to have to be displaced in order for me to do those things, and that&#039;s always the tough part for me. I had dinner a couple evenings with my coworkers at the con, and had an encouraging conversation with them the one evening. I&#039;m hoping that we as a company can allow a little bit of time to contribute code and maintain some modules, but I know it&#039;s difficult to work that in around client work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    So: it was a good week. I learned a lot, both about Drupal, and about what I can be doing for Drupal. I hope that by the time the Denver con rolls around, I&#039;ll be a lot more involved and have a couple more modules under my belt - and certainly, I&#039;ll get more sleep beforehand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

 <title>DrupalCon Chicago Prep</title>
 <link>http://drupaldork.com/2011/03/drupalcon-chicago-prep</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; property=&quot;content:encoded&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;I never did get around to writing anything about the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.lullabot.com/events/workshops/webchick&quot;&gt;Webchick Drupal 7 Tour&lt;/a&gt; after the Lullabots came through DC a few weeks ago, but at this point, DrupalCon looms much larger on everyone&#039;s mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I couldn&#039;t be more excited. Even though I worked for four years at an event management company, and handled on-site IT for several technology conferences during that time, I&#039;ve never actually attended a conference. I started working with Drupal just a few months before &lt;a href=&quot;http://sf2010.drupal.org/&quot;&gt;San Francisco&lt;/a&gt;, so it was too late to make arrangements to go by the time I really got into the project, and I couldn&#039;t afford a trip to Europe for Copenhagen. But, I have spent the past year attending the Drupal meetups here in town and occasional training events (like the Webchick tour), and from everything I&#039;ve seen, next week is going to be a big hotel full of 3000 people that I&#039;d really like to hang out with. They say, &quot;Come for the code, stay for the community,&quot; and it&#039;s true: the Drupal community is so much friendlier and more welcoming than that of any other open source project I&#039;ve dealt with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think I&#039;m just about ready to head to Chicago for the week. I definitely wanted to make time to get a module in contrib before DrupalCon, and I managed &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.drupaldork.com/2011/03/webform-ab-testing-module-released&quot;&gt;to post two&lt;/a&gt;. I know what sessions I want to attend. I figured out how to get to my airport here, and to the hotel in Chicago. This weekend, I&#039;m going to knock out a good chunk of a freelancing project I&#039;ve been working on so that I don&#039;t have to worry too much about that. The only thing I&#039;m concerned about right now is striking a balance between the scheduled sessions, and the BOFs, code sprints, and other ad hoc goings-on that I don&#039;t want to miss out on. It&#039;s shaping up to be a pretty incredible week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And now that it&#039;s nearly 1 AM, I should really get to bed and stock up on sleep, because I sure won&#039;t be getting any in Chicago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
